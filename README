==================

This is a personal website, hosted on https://neocities.org, which
hosts static websites for free, intending to bring back the glory of
the old web where instead of giant corporations dictating every move,
the individuals made their mark with creativity and collaboration.

This website will be built by HTML and CSS only. No javascript. The
goal is to have a personalized corner in the web, primarily with the
aesthetic of retro consoles.
